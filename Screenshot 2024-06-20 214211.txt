The chart illustrates the Profit After Tax (PAT) and PAT margin for Eicher Motors over four financial years. In FY 2019-20, the company recorded a PAT of Rs. 1,903.82 crores with a healthy PAT margin of 21%. However, both PAT and PAT margin experienced a significant decline in FY 2020-21, dropping to Rs. 1,329.70 crores and 15.4% respectively.

Overall Summary: 
Eicher Motors' PAT and PAT margin reflect a volatile yet ultimately positive trend. The company faced a setback in FY 2020-21 due to the pandemic's impact but showcased resilience by achieving a strong recovery in the subsequent years. The significant increase in PAT in FY 2022-23, surpassing pre-pandemic levels, indicates successful strategic decisions, improved market conditions, and potentially enhanced operational efficiency. This positive financial performance positions Eicher Motors well for future growth and profitability.
