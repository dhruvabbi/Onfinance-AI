While EPL Limited initially improved its profitability, as evidenced by the rising EBITDA margin in FY20, the subsequent years showed a declining trend. This suggests potential challenges in maintaining profitability, possibly due to increasing costs or competitive pressures.

However, the company needs to address the underlying factors impacting its margins to ensure sustainable growth and investor confidence in the long term.
