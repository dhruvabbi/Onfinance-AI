Overall Summary:
The shareholding pattern of EIH Limited as of March 31, 2023, reveals a company largely controlled by the Promoters and significantly invested in by institutional investors. This suggests a level of stability and confidence in the company's management and future prospects. The relatively small proportion of shares held by individual investors might indicate that the company's stock is primarily considered a long-term investment rather than a target for active trading.
