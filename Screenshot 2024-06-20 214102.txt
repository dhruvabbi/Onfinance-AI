The consistent rise in revenue from FY 2020-21 onwards suggests a successful diversification strategy employed by Eicher Motors, reducing its dependence on motorcycle sales and tapping into new revenue streams.

Overall Summary:
Eicher Motors has witnessed impressive growth in its non-motorcycling segment revenue over the past four fiscal years. Despite a slight dip in FY 2020-21, likely due to the pandemic's impact, the company achieved a remarkable turnaround, more than doubling its revenue from FY 2020-21 to FY 2022-23. This signifies a successful strategic move towards diversifying revenue streams and reducing reliance on the volatile motorcycle market. The growth also indicates a strong brand presence and successful marketing of their apparel, accessories, and services, attracting a wider customer base.
