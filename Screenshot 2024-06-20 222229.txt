Initially, from April 2022 to June 2022, the CNX Nifty index shows a downward trend, declining from approximately 17,000.00 to around 15,500.00. In contrast, ETL's stock price demonstrates a slight upward trend during the same period, rising from about 1,200.00 to 1,400.00.

Overall Summary: 
The plot indicates that while ETL's stock price broadly mirrors the trend of the CNX Nifty index, it demonstrates periods of relative outperformance, particularly during the initial months when the CNX Nifty declined. This suggests that factors specific to ETL might have positively influenced its stock price during that period. However, it's important to note that this analysis is based solely on monthly high prices and doesn't consider trading volumes, market sentiment, or company-specific news. A comprehensive understanding of ETL's stock performance requires further investigation into these factors.
