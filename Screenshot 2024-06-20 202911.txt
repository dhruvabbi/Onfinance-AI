In FY20, the number of domestic air passengers was 141.20 Million. This number drastically decreased to 53.33 Million in FY21, representing a 62.28% drop.

Overall Summary: 
The Indian domestic aviation sector experienced a significant downturn in FY21 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as reflected in the sharp decline in passenger numbers. However, the industry has shown strong signs of recovery in FY22 and FY23, with passenger numbers steadily climbing towards pre-pandemic levels. This resurgence in domestic air travel indicates renewed consumer confidence and a positive outlook for the aviation industry's growth in the coming years.
