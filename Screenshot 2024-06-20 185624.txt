However, without units for the BSE SENSEX, it's impossible to quantify the strength of this correlation.
Overall Summary:
The plot reveals that Parry Limited's share price has fluctuated over the year, mirroring the overall market trend represented by the BSE SENSEX. Both experienced a dip followed by a peak around October 2022 and a subsequent decline. This suggests that Parry Limited's performance might be influenced by broader market forces.
