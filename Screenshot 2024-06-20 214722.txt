The bar graph showcases Eicher Motors' motorcycle production volume over four financial years. In FY 2019-20, the company produced 6,79,413 motorcycles. This figure slightly decreased to 6,23,280 motorcycles in FY 2020-21, representing a decline of approximately 8.3%. Production further dipped to 6,00,441 motorcycles in FY 2021-22. However, Eicher Motors witnessed a significant surge in motorcycle production in FY 2022-23, reaching 8,32,179 units, a substantial increase of about 38.6% compared to the previous year.
Overall Summary: 
Eicher Motors' motorcycle production experienced fluctuations over the four years, with a decline in the first three years followed by a significant rebound in FY 2022-23. The initial decline could be attributed to various factors, including the global chip shortage, supply chain disruptions caused by the pandemic, or potentially lower demand. However, the substantial increase in production in FY 2022-23 suggests a recovery from these challenges, potentially driven by easing supply chain constraints, successful inventory management, and a resurgence in demand for the company's motorcycles. This positive trend in production volume bodes well for Eicher Motors' future growth and market share.
