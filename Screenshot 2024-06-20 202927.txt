This bar graph illustrates the number of Foreign Tourist Arrivals (in Millions) in India over four fiscal years: FY20, FY21, FY22, and FY23. The data is sourced from the Ministry of Tourism. In FY20, India welcomed 10.93 Million foreign tourists. However, this number drastically declined to 2.74 Million in FY21, representing a 74.93% drop due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent travel restrictions. While FY22 saw a slight recovery with 1.52 Million arrivals, it was still significantly lower than pre-pandemic levels. The positive trend emerged in FY23, with foreign tourist arrivals reaching 6.19 Million, marking a substantial 307.89% increase compared to FY22.
Overall Summary:
The Indian tourism sector, particularly inbound tourism, was severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as evident from the sharp decline in foreign tourist arrivals in FY21 and FY22. However, the significant rebound in FY23 signals a positive trend toward recovery. The substantial increase in foreign tourist arrivals indicates renewed global interest in traveling to India and suggests a positive outlook for the tourism industry's revival in the coming years.
